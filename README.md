# TimezUp
A JavaFX-TimeApp which is comparable to Smartphone-Clock-Apps. It featurs your Local-Time, a stopwatch and a timer. It is very simple and doesn't include any further possibilities than necessary.

### Disclaimer
It is possible that errors occure with the font I used. I included it in the files, but this way sometimes doesn't work very well.
You can get the font [here](https://fontzone.net/font-details/autumn-regular "Autumn-Font").

Also I have a unfixed error with resisizing the window.
-> window.setResizable(false) changed the whole layout of my applet
